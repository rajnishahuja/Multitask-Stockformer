EXPERIMENT PLAN: Improve Model Performance
===========================================

Current Issues:
- Predictions too conservative (std 0.29% vs actual 2.44%)
- Correlation: -0.035 (essentially random)
- Direction accuracy: 50.77% (barely better than random)

Proposed Changes:

CHANGE 1: Loss Weighting (regression_weight = 3.0)
--------------------------------------------------
Location: MultiTask_Stockformer_train.py, line 318
Change: loss = loss_regress + loss_class
To:     loss = 3.0 * loss_regress + 1.0 * loss_class

Rationale: Prioritize getting return magnitudes right over just direction

CHANGE 2: Increase Learning Rate (0.001 → 0.002)
--------------------------------------------------
Location: config/Multitask_NIFTY200_Alpha158.conf, line 62
Change: learning_rate = 0.001
To:     learning_rate = 0.002

Rationale: Escape conservative local minimum, explore more aggressively

CHANGE 3: Reduce Early Stopping Patience (30 → 15)
---------------------------------------------------
Location: MultiTask_Stockformer_train.py, line 255
Change: early_stop_patience = 30
To:     early_stop_patience = 15

Rationale: Model converges quickly, save training time

Expected Improvements:
- Wider prediction range (closer to actual volatility)
- Better correlation (target > 0.05)
- Higher direction accuracy (target > 55%)

Run Time: ~60 minutes (20 epochs, likely stops earlier with patience=15)
